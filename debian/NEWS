npm (1.1.4~dfsg3-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  npm is meant to be used as a normal user.
  Avoid using npm as root.

  Self-installation is possible
  =============================

  Npm can now preserve its configuration across self-updates: `npm update npm`
  is now allowed, and the npm-updated version would go to /usr/local/bin/npm.
  
  To achieve this, debianized npm is left unpatched, apart from cosmetic changes
  that don't break if npm is self-updated.

  It is nonetheless strongly advised to update npm through the debian package.
  Doing so might break npm, or worse, your system, especially if npm is used in
  global mode (see below).
  To fall back to npm installed by debian package, simply remove /usr/local/bin/npm.

  Configuration changes
  =====================
  
  Global mode (root user)
  -----------------------
  
  * /etc/npm/rootrc and userrc are removed, global config is in /etc/npmrc.
  * The new globalignorefile is /etc/npmignore.
  * /usr/local/lib/nodejs has moved to /usr/local/lib/node_modules,
    and is no more on the node path by default. See npm-link(1) for a better usage.

  Local mode
  ----------
  
  * Modules are not installed in ~/.node_libraries, but in per-project's
    ./node_modules directory.
  * Executables are not linked in ~/bin, but in per-project's node_modules/.bin.

  Please read npm-config(1), npm-folders(1) and npm-link(1) man pages.
