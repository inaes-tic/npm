npm (1.1.4~dfsg1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  Self-installation
  =================

  Npm can now preserve its configuration across self-updates: `npm update npm`
  is now allowed, and the npm-updated version would go to /usr/local/bin/npm.
  
  To achieve this, debianized npm is left unpatched, apart from cosmetic changes
  that don't break if npm is self-updated.

  It is nonetheless strongly advised to update npm through the debian package.
  To fall back to npm installed by debian package, simply remove /usr/local/bin/npm.

  Configuration changes
  =====================
  
  Global mode (root user)
  -----------------------
  
  * /etc/npm/rootrc and userrc are removed, global config is in /etc/npmrc.
  * The new globalignorefile is /etc/npmignore.
  * /usr/local/lib/nodejs has moved to /usr/local/lib/node_modules,
    and is no more on the node path by default. See npm-link(1) for a better usage.

  Local mode
  ----------
  
  * Modules are not installed in ~/.node_libraries, but in per-project's
    ./node_modules directory.
  * Executables are not linked in ~/bin, but in per-project's node_modules/.bin.

  Please read npm-config(1), npm-folders(1) and npm-link(1) man pages.
