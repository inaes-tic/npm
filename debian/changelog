npm (1.1.4~dfsg2-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Jérémy Lal ]
  * License changed to Expat+no-false-attribs :
    + http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2012/03/msg00030.html
    + Use license from version 1.1.5, where the meaning of "Author" is clearer.
  * Dependencies :
    + node >= 0.6.12
    + node-node-uuid
    + node-request
    + node-mkdirp
  * DFSG repackaging (using cdbs upstream-tarball.mk), remove :
    + non-free html/*/GubbleBum-Blocky.ttf
    + dependency node_modules/node-uuid
    + dependency node_modules/request
    + dependency node_modules/mkdirp
  * Patches :
    + Drop patch to remove shebangs of non-executable files, applied upstream.
    + Drop patch to fix completion, it wasn't necessary.
    + Comply with license : change upstream author's bug reporting
      email addresses and urls with information on how to report debian bugs.
  * npm can now be configured to follow FHS for root usage, though discouraged :
    + prefix is /usr/local, globalconfig is /etc/npmrc,
    + /etc/npm/rootrc and /etc/npm/userrc are removed,
    + the configuration is kept after `npm -g update npm`.
  * npm is also a node module :
    + it can be "required",
    + it has man(3) documentation.
  * Documentation :
    + npm looks for its own manpages in /usr/share/npm/man, so add symlinks to
      the proper location in /usr/share/man.
    + Fix gz extension, override lintian errors.
    + Install and register html with doc-base.
  * debian/watch updated : github url update, tarball from npm registry.
  * debian/README.Debian updated.

  * Update copyright file:
    + Stop listing convenience copy of uuid.js: no longer included.
    + Extend a copyright year.
    + Abbreviate author middle name (to match upstream change).
