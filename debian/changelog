npm (1.1.4~dfsg2-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Jérémy Lal ]
  * Dependencies :
    + node >= 0.6.12
    + node-node-uuid
    + node-request
    + node-mkdirp
  * DFSG repackaging (using cdbs upstream-tarball.mk), remove :
    + non-free html/*/GubbleBum-Blocky.ttf
    + dependency node_modules/node-uuid
    + dependency node_modules/request
    + dependency node_modules/mkdirp
  * Patches :
    + Drop patch to remove shebangs of non-executable files, applied upstream,
    + Drop patch to fix completion, it wasn't necessary,
    + Comply with Expat+no-false-attribs : change upstream author's bug reporting
      email addresses and urls with information on how to report debian bugs.
  * npm can now be configured to follow FHS for root usage, though discouraged :
    + prefix is /usr/local, globalconfig is /etc/npmrc,
    + /etc/npm/rootrc and /etc/npm/userrc are removed,
    + the configuration is kept after `npm -g update npm`.
  * npm is also a node module :
    + it can be "required",
    + it has man(3) documentation.
  * Documentation :
    + npm looks for its own manpages in /usr/share/npm/man, add symlinks to the
      proper location in /usr/share/man. Fix *.gz extension, override lintian error.
    + Install and register html with doc-base.
  * debian/watch updated : github url update, tarball from npm registry.
  * debian/README.Debian updated.

  [ Jonas Smedegaard ]
  * Update copyright file:
    + Stop listing convenience copy of uuid.js: no longer included.
    + Extend a copyright year.
    + Abbreviate author middle name (to match upstream change).

  [ TODO ]
  * Make sure MIT+no-false-attribs license is DFSG, see
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2012/01/msg00104.html
    + Expat+no-false-attribs is DFSG provided some reformulation
      that's been done in npm github repository.
  * Package ./node_modules/* that have a valid license, and since there is already
    a good reason to DFSG-repackage, exclude them from tarball using
    DEB_UPSTREAM_REPACKAGE_EXCLUDES in debian/rules.
    + modules not from upstream author are already covered
    + modules from upstream author and having a valid license are listed in
      debian/copyright.
  * Generate html and man pages from ronnjs. Exclude them too.
    + nodejs >= 0.6.12 ships node-marked. Check if npm will use that tool.
