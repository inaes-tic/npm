npm (1.0.95-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Jérémy Lal ]
  * npm can now be configured to follow FHS for root usage :
    + prefix is /usr/local, globalconfig is /etc/npmrc.
    + /etc/npm/rootrc and /etc/npm/userrc are removed.
    + the configuration is kept after `npm -g update npm`, which is now allowed.
  * Install and prefix by 'npm-' man(3) manpages.
  * Symlink manpages with wrong ext so npm doesn't need a patch to search
    for *.1.gz man pages. Override lintian error.
  * Install and register html documentation with doc-base.
  * Drop patch to remove shebangs of non-executable files, applied upstream.
  * Drop patch to fix completion, it wasn't broken.
  * debian/watch updated : github url update, tarball from npm registry.
  * debian/README.Debian updated.

  * Update copyright file:
    + Stop listing convenience copy of uuid.js: no longer included.
    + Extend a copyright year.
    + Abbreviate author middle name (to match upstream change).

  [ TODO ]

  * Migrate from npm < 1.0 with  scripts/clean-old.sh
